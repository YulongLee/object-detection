## [MTCNN: Joint Face Detection and Alignment using Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks](https://github.com/YunYang1994/ai-notebooks/blob/master/MTCNN.md)
--------------------
This repository is the implementation of MTCNN in TF2.  It is written from scratch, using as a reference the implementation of MTCNN from David Sandberg Project: [facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).

## Inference
Just download the repository and then do this

```bashrc
$ python main.py
```

The detection results contains three part:

- **Face classification**: the probability produced by the network that indi- cates a sample being a face
- **Bounding box regression**: the bounding boxesâ€™ left top, height, and width.
- **Facial landmark localization**: There are five facial landmarks, including left eye, right eye, nose, left mouth corner, and right mouth corner
